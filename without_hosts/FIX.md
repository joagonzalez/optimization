Yes, exactly! If you want to first find the maximum utilization for each cluster independently and then minimize among those maximums, you would need to:

1. Create a z[c] variable for each cluster
2. Set constraints for each cluster's z[c] to be greater than its resource utilizations
3. Then minimize over all z[c]

The modification would look something like this:
```python
# Instead of one z variable
# z = mdl.continuous_var(name='z')

# Create z[c] for each cluster
z = mdl.continuous_var_dict(clusters, name='z')

# For each cluster, z[c] must be >= all resource utilizations in that cluster
for c in clusters:
    for r in resources:
        current_resource_usage = current_usage[c][r] * cluster_capacity[c][r]
        mdl.add_constraint(
            (mdl.sum(vm_demand[v][r] * x[v,c] for v in new_vms) +
            current_resource_usage) / cluster_capacity[c][r] <= z[c]
        )

# Minimize the maximum z[c]
mdl.minimize(mdl.max(z[c] for c in clusters))
```

This way:
1. Each z[c] will represent the maximum utilization in cluster c
2. The objective will find the minimum among these cluster maximums
3. You'll be able to see the maximum utilization for each cluster separately in the solution

This better matches your description of finding the maximum utilization per cluster and then minimizing among those maximums.
