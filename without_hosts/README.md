Let's break down this constraint:

```python
# Min utilization constraints
for r in resources:        # For each resource (cpu, mem, disk)
    for c in clusters:     # For each cluster (c1, c2)
        # Get the total capacity for this resource in this cluster
        total_capacity = cluster_capacity[c][r]

        # Get current usage (including existing VMs) in absolute units
        current_resource_usage = current_usage[c][r] * total_capacity

        # Create constraint: (new_vms_usage + current_usage) / total_capacity >= z
        constraint = mdl.add_constraint(
            # Sum of resource usage from all new VMs placed in this cluster
            (mdl.sum(vm_demand[v][r] * x[v,c] for v in new_vms) +
            # Plus current resource usage
            current_resource_usage)
            # Divided by total capacity to get utilization percentage
            / total_capacity >= z
        )
```

Let's use a concrete example:
```python
clusters = ['c1', 'c2']
resources = ['cpu', 'mem', 'disk']
new_vms = ['vm3']

# Current usage (percentages)
current_usage = {
    'c1': {'cpu': 0.6, 'mem': 0.5, 'disk': 0.4},
    'c2': {'cpu': 0.7, 'mem': 0.4, 'disk': 0.3}
}

# Capacity in absolute units
cluster_capacity = {
    'c1': {'cpu': 100.0, 'mem': 100.0, 'disk': 100.0},
    'c2': {'cpu': 100.0, 'mem': 100.0, 'disk': 100.0}
}

# New VM demand in absolute units
vm_demand = {
    'vm3': {'cpu': 5.0, 'mem': 20.0, 'disk': 10.0}
}
```

For cluster c1, CPU resource, the constraint would be:
```
(5.0 * x['vm3','c1'] + 60.0) / 100.0 >= z
```
Where:
- 5.0 is vm3's CPU demand
- x['vm3','c1'] is 1 if vm3 is placed in c1, 0 otherwise
- 60.0 is current CPU usage (0.6 * 100.0)
- 100.0 is total CPU capacity
- z is the variable we're trying to maximize

Similar constraints are created for all combinations of resources and clusters:
```
# For c1:
CPU:    (5.0 * x['vm3','c1'] + 60.0) / 100.0 >= z
Memory: (20.0 * x['vm3','c1'] + 50.0) / 100.0 >= z
Disk:   (10.0 * x['vm3','c1'] + 40.0) / 100.0 >= z

# For c2:
CPU:    (5.0 * x['vm3','c2'] + 70.0) / 100.0 >= z
Memory: (20.0 * x['vm3','c2'] + 40.0) / 100.0 >= z
Disk:   (10.0 * x['vm3','c2'] + 30.0) / 100.0 >= z
```

The optimizer will:
1. Try to maximize z
2. Ensure all these constraints are satisfied
3. Find the best placement (values for x) that gives the highest minimum utilization (z)

This ensures that:
- The utilization of each resource in each cluster will be at least z
- By maximizing z, we're trying to achieve the highest possible minimum utilization
- This helps balance the load across clusters and resources
